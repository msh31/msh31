# Hey! 👋 I'm Marco

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves diving deep into how things work. When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with hardware or exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm studying Software Development in The Netherlands and I'm passionate about systems programming and understanding technology at its core.

Currently looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals. Feel free to reach out if you know of any exciting opportunities!
