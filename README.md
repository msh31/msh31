# Hey! 👋 I'm Marco

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves diving deep into how things work. When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with hardware or exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm studying Software Development in The Netherlands and I'm passionate about systems programming and understanding technology at its core.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### **[Sentinel](https://github.com/msh31/sentinel)**  <small>| Work in progress!</small>
This is my passion project where I'm building a Windows security SDK. This is a project where I learn about anti-debug techniques and VM detection. I'm excited to share it with the community and get feedback!

### **[HTTP Server](https://github.com/msh31/http-server)**
I built this simple HTTP 1.1 server from scratch in C++ to really understand the HTTP protocol. It was a great learning experience and I'm proud of how it turned out!

### **[ESP32 Command & Control](https://github.com/msh31/esp32-command-control)**
A simple handler-agent network using the ESP-NOW protocol and 3 ESP32s. It features a star topology network with basic encryption and a CLI to send commands to agents. This project has been a great way to understand wireless communication and network security!

<!-- ### **[x86-x64 bootloader](https://github.com/msh31/bootloader)** 
A very, very simple bootloader to mess with writing assembly and learning about Operating Systems. It's a small project, but it's taught me a lot already! -->
